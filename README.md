# js-code-quiz-AWY

## Description

In this assignment we were to build a Javascript quiz that cycled through questions which provided the user with multiple choice options for answers and a timer . If the user chose an incorrect answer the timer was supposed to be docked. The user was then supposed to have the option to store their score and initials when the game was over.The game was over when the timer ran out or all the questions were answered.
