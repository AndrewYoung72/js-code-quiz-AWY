# js-code-quiz-AWY

## Requirements

In this assignment we were to build a Javascript quiz that cycled through questions which provided the user with multiple choice options for answers and a timer . If the user chose an incorrect answer the timer was supposed to be docked. The user was then supposed to have the option to store their score and initials when the game was over.The game was over when the timer ran out or all the questions were answered.

## My Project

As you can see in my deplolyment, my project does not meet all the criteria. I had my project to the point of meeting all but two of the citeria, the timer deduction for a wrong answer and the local storage for initials and score. I asked for aditional help to get me pointed in the right direction on both of those criteria but I have not been able to get them to run. Whenever I add arguments to deduct the timer or register an event for the correct answer it messses up the functinallity of my game. Now my game only presents two questions before the end of game prompt. I lack the knowledge on how to fix this issue so I was forced to turn in what I have. I am trying an online site to help me learn javascript. I can understand how it works when I see it but I don't know where to begin after I have constructed the variables I need.
